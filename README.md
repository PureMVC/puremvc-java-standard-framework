## [PureMVC](http://puremvc.github.com/) Java Standard Framework

PureMVC is a lightweight framework for creating applications based upon the classic [Model-View-Controller](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model-view-controller) design meta-pattern. This is the specific implementation for the [Java](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)) language. It does not support [modular programming](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_programming) since it uses [Singletons](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singleton_pattern) as Core actors rather than the [Multiton](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiton) used in the [MultiCore](https://github.com/PureMVC/puremvc-java-multicore-framework/wiki) Version.
