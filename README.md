## [PureMVC](http://puremvc.github.com/) Java Standard Framework - LEGACY IMPLEMENTATION
### For the current implementation go [here](https://github.com/PureMVC/puremvc-java-standard-framework/wiki)
PureMVC is a lightweight framework for creating applications based upon the classic [Model-View-Controller](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model-view-controller) design meta-pattern. This is a Java port of the [AS3 reference implementation of the Standard Version](https://github.com/PureMVC/puremvc-as3-standard-framework/wiki). It does not support modular programming since it uses [Singleton](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singleton_pattern)s as Core actors rather than the [Multiton](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiton)s used in the [MultiCore](https://github.com/PureMVC/puremvc-java-multicore-framework/wiki/) Version.
